# Contributing to Careem Pay Merchant Plugin

## Using Github 
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!
